But to make any astronomical observation, you need to know precisely where to look, that is, the location of celestial objects in our night sky. Spherical or positional astronomy is a sub-field of astronomy that deals with the directions in which these celestial objects are viewed and predicts how they vary over space and time. One of the most ancient forms of science, here we learn how to locate objects on the celestial sphere — as seen at a particular date, time, and location on Earth — just as we measure positions on Earth's surface by Latitude and Longitude. Along the way, we also will encounter certain astronomical phenomena observed on Earth."

What are the processes used to detect its presence someplace millions of light years away from us? And how successful have we been in our search until now?

            "abstract": "Over 200 species have been detected in the cold, neutral regions of the ISM over the past 80 years. The existence of such a rich and diverse range of chemistry even at very low temperatures and densities, raises several interesting questions about the origin of these species and how the energy barrier for reactions is surpassed at such low temperatures. The hunt for answers has led to the highly interdisciplinary field of Astrochemistry. Astrochemistry proceeds on 3 interlinked fronts, namely - observations, modelling and laboratory experiments. Laboratory astrochemistry is central to enhancing our understanding of the present composition of ISM, as well as the chemical origins of the universe. Laboratory spectroscopy aids observations in confirming the detection of new species in space. On the modelling front, parameters such as rate constants and branching ratios are required and can only be measured experimentally. The measurement of these parameters in a laboratory while mimicking the conditions in space, is a multi-fold challenge. This has led to the development of several novel experimental techniques, and innovative combinations of existing methods. The aim of this talk is therefore, to highlight the various experimental techniques involved in laboratory astrochemistry. More specifically, I will be discussing the novel CRESUCHIRP apparatus developed by Dr. Ian Sims and his group at the University of Rennes, where I worked over the summer."

            "abstract": "Binary stars, comprising more than 90% of the stars we see in our night sky, play a significant role in all kinds of astrophysical research. A peculiarly interesting category is x-ray binary, which happens to have compact stellar remnants, specifically a neutron star as one of their components. X-ray binaries act as space-based laboratories, allowing us to study the physics of accretion and the neutron star with good proximity observations. They also serve as progenitor systems to some exotic objects like millisecond pulsars and ultra-compact binaries releasing gravitational waves. For more than a year now, I've been working on modelling a class of such X-ray binaries using tools like MESA(Modules of Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), the state-of-the-art Fortran-based 1D stellar simulation package. In the talk, I plan to start with a discussion about different classes of X-ray binaries and their wide applicability in astrophysics in the first part. Secondly, I’ll present a small overview of my thesis work and the significance of such theoretical studies. I’ll conclude the talk by talking about MESA, why it is important for anyone interested in working in astrophysics and how to use it as a beginner."

A mass curves the spacetime around it, and both massive and massless particles follow the curvature of the spacetime. Motion (translational, rotational or vibrational) of massive particles generate ripples in the spacetime or gravitational waves. Like electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves also have a wide range of frequencies. Gravitational waves of different frequencies are created by different sources āand we need different types of detectors to detect them. There is an innovative āmethod to detect low-frequency gravitational waves by using a number of undead stars as the detectors. These low-frequency gravitational waves are caused by mergers of supermassive black holes, and not only one mergers, many mergers resulting a summed-up background wave. As pulsars are the special type of undead star used for this purpose, we call such experiments as Pulsar Timing Array experiments. Presently, there are multiple Pulsar Timing Array experiments ongoing in various continents. These groups recently declared their results revealing a hint of the low-frequency gravitational waves. Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) is an Indo-Japanese collaboration performing PTA experiment using Indian telescope, the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. In the present talk, I will briefly discuss low-frequency gravitational waves, the basics of a PTA experiment, and the contribution of InPTA in this field."

In this talk, we will explore the various physical and chemical processes that contribute to cloud formation on exoplanets, such as condensation, nucleation, and growth. We will also discuss how cloud properties such as composition, size, and distribution can vary depending on the specific environmental conditions of the exoplanetary atmosphere, such as temperature, pressure, and atmospheric composition. In the end, we will review the current theoretical approaches for studying cloud formation in exoplanets and their impacts on observational interpretation and highlight some of the key challenges and open questions in this rapidly-evolving field of research."
