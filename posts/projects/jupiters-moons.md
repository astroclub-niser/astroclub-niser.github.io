## AIMS

- Measure the Orbital Periods of Io, Europa, Ganyemede & Callisto
- Observe and learn about orbital resonance in action. 

## Equipment

Planned to be done using the 8” telescope. 
This will improve the skill in those who know how to setup the 8”. More will be inspired to learn the 8” to do the experiment as well

## Duration

2 - 3 months, between October to December.

Data to be recorded every day for the first 7 days, maybe alternate days there on.

## Analysis

Use the CCD to capture pictures of Jupiter every night over a span of 2 - 3 months. 

Plot distance of the moon $r(t)$ vs time $t$. Fit this to a sin wave and find the orbital period.

Use this information to study about orbital resonance and find the resonance conditions for various moons.
