The experiment measured the orbital periods of Jupiter's four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—using a 6-inch telescope and a smartphone camera. Observations were conducted over multiple nights, with precise timestamps recorded for each image. A custom Python program processed the images to determine the moons' positions relative to Jupiter, enabling the modeling of their orbits and calculation of orbital periods. Relative errors were minimal, verifying Kepler’s Third Law and Laplace resonance for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This demonstrates how affordable tools can facilitate meaningful astronomical research.
